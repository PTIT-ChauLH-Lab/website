<p>

You will also notice that we have highlighted certain parts of the text throughout the User Guide, such as important pieces of information, useful tips, and helpful code snippets, with different formatting for an easier overview. Here are some examples of the different formatting we use for Important Notes, Useful Tips, and Code Snippets:</p>
<div class="alert alert-error">
	This is an important note</div>
	<br>
<div class="alert alert-info">
	This is a useful tip</div>
<p>
	In this first section of the academix User Guide we will go through the essential steps required to start building your website with the academix theme. We will explain how to install the theme, import the included demo content, as well as how to update the theme. At the end of this section you will also find a set of Frequently Asked Question related to troubleshooting the theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
	Before you can start playing around with your new theme, let&#39;s first check what the theme package includes. After you have downloaded the .zip file from Themeforest and unzipped it, it should reveal the following folders:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Demo Content</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>academix.zip Theme</li>
<li>academix-child Child Theme</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="getting_started_installing_academix">Installing academix</h4>
<p>
	After downloading the academix installation file from ThemeForest, extract it and in the extracted folder locate the <em>academix.zip</em> file. You can then install the academix theme using one of two methods described below.</p>
<p>
	It really doesn&#39;t matter at all which one of these techniques you want to use, so choose the one which seems to make more sense to you.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>WordPress upload</strong>&nbsp;- For most users, this is probably the simplest installation method. To install the academix theme using this method, please follow these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Login to your WordPress admin panel</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to&nbsp;<strong><em>Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Add New &gt; Upload Theme</em></strong></li>
			<li>
				Click on <strong><em>Choose File</em></strong> and select&nbsp;<em>academix.zip</em></li>
			<li>
				Click on <strong><em>Install Now</em></strong></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>FTP upload</strong>&nbsp;- If you would like to install the academix theme via FTP, please follow these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Extract the <em>academix.zip&nbsp;</em>file you previously located. You should now see a folder named <em>academix</em></li>
			<li>
				Using an FTP client, login to the server where your WordPress website is hosted</li>
			<li>
				Using an FTP client, navigate to the&nbsp;<em>/wp-content/themes/</em>&nbsp;directory under your WordPress website&#39;s root directory</li>
			<li>
				Using an FTP client, upload the previously extracted&nbsp;<em>academix&nbsp;</em>folder to the themes directory on your remote server</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>


<h4 id="getting_started_updating_academix">Activate the Theme</h4>
<p>
	Once the installation is complete, your academix theme will be ready for use. Now all you need to do is navigate to <b>Appearance > Themes</b> and activate the academix theme. After you have done this, you should see there one more theme called  academix. Find it and just click Activate (if theme was uploaded via FTP).
</p>

<p><span><img alt="template" class="image_center" src="assets/images/activate2.png" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"></span></p>
<p>
	Or click <b>Activate</b> right after theme was installed (if it was installed with Theme Uploader)
</p>

<p><span>
	<img alt="template" class="image_center" src="assets/images/activate.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"></span></p>


<p>
	 After you have done this, you should also see <strong><em>notification</em></strong> that appears in the left navigation bar of &nbsp;your WordPress admin panel. It require plugins that need to be installed. Please install and activate all of the required plugins, since they are necessary for the theme to function properly</p>

<p>
	In this section of the&nbsp;User Guide we will discuss the creation of blog posts and all the available options for each post, setting up pages to display blog listings, as well as how to change the date format for your posts.</p>
<h4 id="blog_blog_posts">Blog Posts</h4>
<p>
	To create a new blog post, go to<strong>&nbsp;<em>Posts &gt; Add New</em></strong>&nbsp;from your WordPress admin panel. First, you need to enter a title for your blog post in the text field near the top of the screen. Then choose a format for your blog post in the <strong><em>Format</em></strong> section&nbsp;on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/post.jpg">
<p>
	Let&#39;s take a look at the available blog post formats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Standard</strong> - This is the default blog format.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/blog2.png"></p>
<p>
	Now it&#39;s time to categorize this post:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Beneath the <em><strong>Format</strong>&nbsp;</em>section you will see a section named <em><strong>Categories</strong></em>. Here you can select the categories that you would like to add this post to. If you would like to create a new category, click on the <em><strong>+ Add New Category</strong></em>&nbsp;link. A text field will appear in which you can enter a category name, and then click <em><strong>Add New Category</strong></em>.</li>
	<li>
		Once you&#39;ve selected the categories you would like to add your post to, click the <em><strong>Publish</strong></em>&nbsp;button. Congratulations, you&#39;ve just published your first blog post!</li>
	<li>
		Beneath the <em><strong>Categories</strong></em>&nbsp;section&nbsp;you will see the <strong>Tags</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em><strong>Featured Image</strong></em>&nbsp;sections. Here you can add tags to your post, and set a featured image which will be displayed for this post on blog list pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Now that we have published our first blog post, let&rsquo;s go over the available custom fields for blog posts.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
	Note that most of them are the same custom fields you&#39;ll find when creating standard pages.</div>

<p>
	By choosing one of the blog templates you will have set this page to automatically show a list of your blog posts. All you need to do now is publish the page.</p>
<h4 id="blog_date_format">Date Format</h4>
<p>
	If you wish to change the date format on blog posts, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Date Format&nbsp;</strong>from your WordPress admin,&nbsp;and select your format of choice.</p>
</section>
<section id="faq">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>5. Troubleshooting FAQ</h3><hr class="notop"></div>

		<h4 id="getting_started_troubleshooting_faq">Troubleshooting FAQ </h4>
<h5>
	1. Why can&#39;t I save my menu?</h5>
<p>
	WordPress by default has a limited number of menu items. When you import our demo content, which contains a lot of menu items, you might not be able to save changes you make to a menu. You can fix this problem by contacting your hosting and asking them to add the following lines to the php.ini file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-prettypfrint lang-css linenums linenums">
suhosin.post.max_vars = 5000
suhosin.request.max_vars = 5000</pre>
<h5>
	2. Why is there a smiley displayed on blank pages?</h5>
<p>
	This problem is most likely related to JetPack and memory settings of your hosting. You can either disable JetPack or read what the JetPack developer wrote: Regarding the memory limit, please refer to the WordPress Codex section concerning this problem. Some sites that load many plugins alongside WordPress ultimately require a higher memory limit than WordPress defaults to, but since this is limited to specific hosts and configurations, it must be dealt with on an individual basis. You&#39;ll find the Codex article at:&nbsp;<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Common_WordPress_Errors#Allowed_memory_size_exhausted" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Common_WordPress_Errors#Allowed_memory_size_exhausted</a></p>
<h5>
	3. How do I optimize my site?</h5>
<p>
	Please use this tool to investigate reasons for slow loading:&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=en">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=en</a></p>
<h5>
	4. How to translate or rename default theme labels?</h5>
<p>
	You can use the Poedit software (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/" target="_blank">http://poedit.net/wordpress</a>) to translate/rename all the theme&#39;s labels. Another solution is to edit the theme folder/languages/en_US.po file directly in a text editor and manually edit the labels you want to translate.</p>
<h5>
	5. Why do I see a white screen when importing demo content?</h5>
<p>
	If you get a white screen or some other error when trying to import our demo content, this probably happens because of the maximum execution time limit or  max upload file size. You need to increase the maximum execution time (upload time) setting of your web server. The default maximum execution time on web servers is 30 seconds. Please increase it to 120 seconds. Also you may have to increase a limitation of Upload File Size with your Hosting Provider to Max Upload File Size. Possible ways of achieving this are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		By Wp-config.php changes - set_time_limit(120);</li>
	<li>
		In htaccess - php_value max_execution_time 120;</li>
	<li>
		In php.ini file - max_execution_time = 120</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Ask your hosting provider to take care of this for you.</p>
<h4 id="getting_started_updating_academix">Elementor</h4>
<h5>Why do I have an error message about Elementor?</h5>
<p> Theme indicates the king composer has an update, however below  we can see error message. You don't need to pay attention on this error. We are using the Elementor plugin as a simple layout builder with our personal shortcodes, it should not give you any discomforts!</p>
<h5> Can I use Elementor shortcodes?</h5>
<p>You are able to use all the Elementor shortcodes which are related to this theme (theme is created only with that shortcodes that you can use in the moment). However you can use all other shortcodes, but they may not display correctly. Because they are not stylized to the theme styles.</p>
<h4 id="getting_started_updating_academix">Child and Parent theme</h4>
<p>
	A WordPress child theme takes the functionality of another theme, named parent theme. It gives you the possibility to customize an existing theme. Instead of modifying the theme files directly, you can activate the child theme and work within it. All customizations are stored in the child theme and anything in the child takes priority over the parent. So if the same file exist in both child and parent, the file from the child will control that aspect of the theme.</p>
<p>
	Working with child themes, your customizations are safeguarded from future upgrades because you only upgrade the parent theme, which you never edit, while the customizations are protected in your child theme which you don’t upgrade.
</p>
<h5><b><em>Why use a Child theme?</em></b></h5>
<p>
	<b><em>Safe Updates.</em></b> You can easily modify your website using child themes without ever changing the parent theme. When a new version of the parent theme appears, you can safely update it as all your modifications are saved in the child theme.
</p>
<p>
	<b><em>Easy to Extend.</em></b> A child theme has a great flexibility. It does not require writing a lot of code. You can modify only those template files and functions that you need.
</p>
<p>
	<b><em>Notice!</em></b> When you install one of our themes you must upload both parent and child theme folders to /wp-content/themes/ but you should only activate the Child theme via Appearance > Themes.
</p>
<h5><b><em>Modifying files from the Parent theme folder</em></b></h5>
<p>
	While you should never edit files in your Parent theme, if you really must, the safest way to do it is to download a copy of the file you want to modify on your computer, make the changes, and then upload it into your child theme folder.
</p>
<p>
	This way of modifying the files can be used for any files from the parent theme — note that you must re-create the same folder structure in your child theme that exist in the parent theme in order for the modifications to take effect.
